## How to run it
</br>

Clone the project into your directory.
```
$> git clone git@github.com:mmarinel/42RomaLuiss__Cub3D.git
```

If you are on mac, go to the macOS branch
```
$> git checkout macOS
```

Make the executable
```
$> make 		-(make the mandatory part)
$> make bonus	-(makes the bonus part)
```

Play the game!
```
$> ./cub3D map/<map-of-your-choice>
```

**Disclaimer**</br>
If you want to make the bonus-part executable and already have the mandatory-part one,</br>
Remake the project with
```
$> make reb		-("re" rule for the bonus part)
```
(that is because, even if the mandatory objects are available, they are compiled with the bonus flag set to "0"; so they will never call the bonus-part object files).

</br>And vice-versa, if you want to make the mandatory-part executable while already having the bonus-part one
```
$> make re
```
